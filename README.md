# FreePomodoroTimer
Free Pomodoro Timer. It's an app for MacOS based on the Pomodoro Technique, where you focus for 25 minutes followed by a 5-minute break. After three consecutive focus sessions, you take a longer 15-minute break. This method is a popular productivity hack, but surprisingly, most decent apps in the App Store aren't free.
