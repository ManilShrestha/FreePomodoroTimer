# FreePomodoroTimer
I'm excited to share the app I developed â€“ Pomodoro Timer. Designed to boost productivity, this app employs the Pomodoro Technique: 25 minutes of focused work followed by a 5-minute break. After three focused sessions, enjoy a well-deserved 15-minute break. While this productivity method is quite popular, I noticed a lack of free, quality apps in the App Store. So, I decided to create one for personal use and am now excited to share it with you. As my first MacOS app using Swift, it was a fun mini-project crafted in just a few hours. Please try it out and share your thoughts. If you have any suggestions or encounter issues, let me know. I'm eager to make improvements and provide updates.
