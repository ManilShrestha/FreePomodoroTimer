# FreePomodoroTimer
I'm excited to share the app I developed â€“ Pomodoro. It's a straightforward app for MacOS based on the Pomodoro Technique, where you focus for 25 minutes followed by a 5-minute break. After three consecutive focus sessions, you take a longer 15-minute break. This method is a popular productivity hack, but surprisingly, most decent apps in the App Store aren't free. I created this app primarily for personal use and now I'm sharing it with friends and family. Give it a try and let me know if there are any features you'd like added or any issues that need fixing. I'm happy to update and resend it your way.
